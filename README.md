# 👋 Hi, I'm Emily!
🎓 Sophmore at Emory University, Studying Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics

👩‍💻Aspiring Software Engineer!

<ins>🎯 Featured Project: Data Analysis for American Airlines</ins>
- **What We Did:** Extracted and discretized a 5% stratified sample using SQL queries in Snowflake, conducted statistical modeling in SciPy to fit and compare distribution families, and trained a feedforward neural network in PyTorch using synthetic data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning to stabilize and optimize performance
- **Tools:** Python, JuypterNotebooks, SciPy, Pytorch, SQL, Snowflake
- **Result:** Achieved an R² of 0.9568 and built a UI to visualize predictions, enabling American Airlines staff to improve operational planning

<ins>🛠 Tech Stack:</ins>
- **Languages:** Python, Java
- **Data Science:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Web Dev:** HTML
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Selenium, Jsoup, iText
- **Databases:** SQL, Snowflake

<ins>🔭 I’m currently working on:</ins>

**Academic Planning Tool:** I’m building an interactive academic planning tool that generates personalized course schedules and graduation timelines based on users’ majors and completed coursework. The tool features:
- Web-scraping of course and academic data, Input validation, exception handling, course filtering algorithm, PDF export functionality
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Selenium WebDriver, Jsoup, iText, HTML

This project aims to simplify academic planning and help students stay on track toward graduation.
